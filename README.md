Simple Shell
This project is the final project in the first trimester of the ALX SE Program. It is the consolidation of everything we learned in the quarter about System engineering & DevOps and Low-level programming & Algorithm. Using C programming language, we develop our own Shell.

Description
The shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a command line user interface for Unix-like operating systems. The shell is both an interactive command language and a scripting language, and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using shell scripts.

Installation

$ git clone https://github.com/R33dah/simple_shell.git
Next you can compile the files with this command:

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
finally you can run our Shell writing:

./hsh
